I graduated from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. My primary research interests include intelligent agents, LLM reasoning, and LLM-based data synthesis. You can view my resume by clicking here.

I had an internship at Asksia Inc., where I worked on using multi-agent systems to enhance mathematical reasoning capabilities. Currently, I am a Research Assistant at Wuhan University under the supervision of [Professor Juhua Liu](https://jszy.whu.edu.cn/liujuhua1/zh_CN/index.htm), focusing on LLM-based data synthesis and agent's tool-using ability.
